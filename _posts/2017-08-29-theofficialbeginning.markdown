I have already taken Intro to Programming, Photoshop, Access, and HTML & CSS classes through my local community college, so I knew that I really enjoyed the journey towards changing up my career path to Web Development.  In searching for other options online, I found Flatiron and was very interested in the self-paced, community oriented environment it provided.  

Today, I officially begin my journey to work through this online program.  I took a week or two off between my summer class and diving full into the curriculum of Flatiron.  I am excited and yet nervous to dive deeper into all these subjects.  I hope that I will be challenged, but not so much that I feel like I cannot succeed. 

Most of my life, I chased my dream of being an actress.  While living in Los Angeles, my day job was being an Administrative Assistant as I went to auditions and went to gigs.  After I moved to Colorado to be closer to my family, I continued my professional career in an admistrative capacity.  But I wanted more, and to be challenged.  I tried a few types of classes in early child education, law, zoology and programming.  Programming, though challenging, felt like the most rewarding and helpful for the future I hope to have.  

So begins the journey.  Now off to the lessons!
