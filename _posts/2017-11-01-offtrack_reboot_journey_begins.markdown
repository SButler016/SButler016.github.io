After a month of travel, sickness, and being way too busy for my own good.  I am laying down the foundation to firmly begin my coding journey.  It has been one of the hardest things to do when life is full of work, commuting, taking care oneself, and a myriad of other obstacles that can distract.  Through much encouragement, I am picking myself up and moving forward.  I'm trying to lay down the groundwork, to prioritize my coding journey by working on deadlines and schedules.  

For anyone feeling lost or frustrated in their own accountability, I can say I'm there with you.  I have the best intentions, but the journey is hard and it is hard to work full-time and come home to work on homework.  But I know the end of the journey helps me change up my career path, moving me away from being an Administrative Assistant my whole life and moving me toward a challenging and more interesting path.  

Today, November 1st, so far past when I wanted to be focused, I am making a pledge to set class time in my schedule.  I am going to move forward, no excuses.  Time to learn, time to grow and time to look to my future.
